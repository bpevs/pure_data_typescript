WIP Don't expect anything to work.

# Pure Data Typescript
A complete web implementation of Pure Data, using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), and [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

Inspired by [Pure Data](puredata.info), [WebPd](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd), and [PD-Fileutils](https://github.com/sebpiq/pd-fileutils). This project is looking to build upon those by implementing a completely functional gui, so that you can import *.pd files, edit them, listen to them, then export them as *.pd.

# How to run
```sh
npm install
npm run start
# Open on http://localhost:8080/
```
