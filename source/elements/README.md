Elements are the parts that together make up the entire layout of a patch,
including windowsizes and position.

Objects are the building blocks of PureData that contain functionality,
gui-related or not.

Object elements are numbered in order of appearance in the file, all other
elements are excluded from numbering. These numbers are pure virtual and cannot
be seen directly in the file.
